# Snake Game with SARSA Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a **Snake Game** powered by the **SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)** algorithm. The objective of the game is to train the snake to move optimally, eat apples, and avoid collisions by updating a Q-table through reinforcement learning. The snake makes decisions based on its environment and learns from its experiences during gameplay.

## Project Overview
This game uses **SARSA reinforcement learning** to train a snake agent. The agent tries to maximize its rewards by:
- Eating apples to gain points.
- Avoiding collisions with walls or itself.
- Learning a Q-table that represents optimal actions for given states.

The project is implemented using **Python 3.12.4** and **Pygame 2.6.1** for visual rendering of the game environment.

---

## Features
- **SARSA Algorithm**: A reinforcement learning algorithm that updates Q-values based on state-action pairs.
- **Q-table Persistence**: The Q-table is saved and loaded using a pickle file to maintain progress between sessions.
- **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**: The agent balances exploration and exploitation during gameplay.
- **Dynamic Snake Behavior**: The snake changes direction based on trained strategies.
- **Apple Generation**: Apples appear randomly without overlapping with the snake body.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Make sure you are using **Python 3.12.4** and install the required libraries using **pip**.
   
   To create a virtual environment (recommended), run the following commands:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. This will install:
   - **pygame==2.6.1**
   - **matplotlib==3.9.2**
   - **numpy==2.1.3**

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to start the game:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## How It Works

### 1. **Reinforcement Learning (SARSA)**
- **SARSA Algorithm**:  
   - The Q-table stores the expected rewards for state-action pairs.
   - The snake selects actions based on an **epsilon-greedy policy** (random or optimal).
   - After each move, the Q-value is updated using the formula:  
     ```
     Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + α [ r + γ Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) ]
     ```  
   - Where:
     - `Q(s, a)` is the Q-value of the current state-action pair.
     - `r` is the reward.
     - `Q(s', a')` is the future Q-value.
     - `α` is the learning rate, and `γ` is the discount factor.


### 2. **Game Logic**
- **Snake Movement and Collision**:  
   - The snake moves one block at a time, and its body grows when it eats an apple.
   - If the snake collides with the wall or itself, the game resets.

- **State Representation**:  
   - The snake’s state includes:
     - Distance to the apple.
     - Danger indicators (ahead, left, and right).
     - Current direction of the snake.

### 3. **Apple Placement**
- **Randomized Apple Position**:  
   - Apples appear at random positions on the grid.
   - If the apple overlaps with the snake body, a new position is generated.
